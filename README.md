This project is a music equalizer and virtual instruments application that enable the user to choose a song and change the frequencies of certain instruments in this song based on the frequencies range of each 
instrument and then play the song after the modifications.
Also there's an option if the user wants to see the spectrogram of the audio signal and that happens in the first tab.

The second tab contains 3 instruments to enable the user to play on them either by pressing on keyboars with the same letter shown or by pressing them, and the instruments in out GUI are piano, drums, and bangos.

The following photos show the GUI and its results after each user interface.

1- The following photo shows the first tab which contains the main channel that shows the signal and also the spectrogram of the signal with options like zoom, faster, slower, volume up, volume down, play, pause
and also sliders for spectrogram contrast and also color pallettes for the spectrogram.

3-The following photo shows the difference in the signal after changing frequencies of some of the instruments inside the song using the equalizers of each instrument and also after each changing in frequencies
the spectrogram gets updated
